Here's a simple example of a `webpack.config.js` file for a basic setup:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js', // Entry point
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js', // Output file
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/, // Use the babel-loader for JavaScript files
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

INSIDE THE CLIENT FOLDER

Inside the client folder i have created all the neccessary folder and write all the codes that i was required to write


CODE SNIPPET

 if (isDown(game, KEYS.A)) {
        this.sprite.body.angularVelocity = -5 * (this.speed / 1000)
      } else if (isDown(game, KEYS.D)) {
        this.sprite.body.angularVelocity = 5 * (this.speed / 1000)
      } else {
        this.sprite.body.angularVelocity = 0
      }



The provided code appears to be a part of a JavaScript program, likely within a game development context. It is intended to control the angular velocity of an object (possibly a game character or entity) based on user input using the 'A' and 'D' keys. Let's break down what this code intends to achieve and how it accomplishes that:

1. **Input Handling:** The code is likely part of an event handler that is checking for user input. Specifically, it's checking if the 'A' key is pressed down or the 'D' key is pressed down. This is done using the `isDown` function, which checks if a given key is in a "down" state. It's passing two arguments: `game`, which is presumably a game context, and `KEYS.A` or `KEYS.D`, which likely represent key codes or key identifiers.

2. **Angular Velocity Control:**
   - If the 'A' key is pressed (i.e., the player wants to turn left), it sets the angular velocity of an object (referred to as `this.sprite`) to a negative value. The negative value indicates a leftward (counterclockwise) rotation.
   - If the 'D' key is pressed (i.e., the player wants to turn right), it sets the angular velocity of the object to a positive value. The positive value indicates a rightward (clockwise) rotation.
   - If neither 'A' nor 'D' is pressed, the code sets the angular velocity to 0. This effectively stops any rotation.

3. **Velocity Calculation:** The value of the angular velocity is calculated based on the `this.speed` property of the object. It multiplies `this.speed` by 5 and divides the result by 1000. This suggests that the angular velocity is proportional to the object's speed.

In summary, this code snippet is used to control the angular velocity of an object in a game based on user input. When the 'A' key is pressed, it turns the object counterclockwise, when the 'D' key is pressed, it turns the object clockwise, and when neither key is pressed, the object stops rotating. The speed of the rotation is dependent on the object's speed property.


DAY 4

ASSIGNING A SPRITE TO A PLAYER

The provided code appears to be a JavaScript module that is part of a game built with the Phaser game framework and Socket.io for real-time communication. Let's break down what this code is intended to achieve and how it accomplishes those intentions:

   - It defines the `SERVER_IP` as 'http://localhost:8000', which is the server's IP address and port.
   - It initializes a `socket` variable, which is likely used for real-time communication with the server.

3. **Game Class:**
   - It defines a `Game` class that extends `Phaser.State`, indicating that it is a game state.

4. **Constructor:**
   - The constructor initializes an empty `player` object within the state.

5. **Preload Function:**
   - The `preload` function is used to load game assets. It uses the `fileLoader` function to load files into the game.

6. **Create Function:**
   - The `create` function is called when the game state is created. It sets up various game elements and establishes the connection to the server:
     - It configures the game's world size.
     - It creates the game world using the `createWorld` function.
     - It establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using `socket.io`.
     - It creates a player character using the `player` function, passing its initial position and the game's context and socket as arguments.
     - It creates player name and speed text elements.
     - It sends a "new-player" event to the server to notify it of the new player's presence.
     - It calls functions to update information about other players and configure the game camera.

7. **Update Function:**
   - The `update` function is called in a loop to update the game state continuously:
     - It invokes the `drive` method of the player object, which appears to control the player's movement.
     - It updates the game camera position to follow the player character with a smooth transition.
     - It performs player movement interpolation, likely to synchronize the movement of other players in the game world.

8. **Export:**
   - The `Game` class is exported as the default export from this module, making it accessible for use in other parts of the application.

This code represents the main game state and logic, setting up the game world, player character, and communication with the server. It is part of a larger game application and is meant to be used within a Phaser game framework environment.
